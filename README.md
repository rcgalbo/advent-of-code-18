# 2018 advent of code
- 2019 completion

day 1: no issues, didn't take too long
day 2: similar, not too tricky. would have liked to be a little niceer
day 3: distracted, took much longer than necessary - datastructure was bad choice for finding the singular claim
day 4: forever and I eneded up finishing it in R which was very good for this data manipulation
day 5: did't take that long but the soluiton gives off by one errors because of the way that i wrote the iterator
day 6: took too long but had better approach, still overcomplicated but less so
day 7: took long and was mostly because I was willing to hack without datastructures and didn't read 60+ 
day 8: took two days, very difficult for me to phrase recursively for some reason
day 9: took longer than I wanted but an improvement over the last one, silent failure and hidden state still need to work on 
...
day 15: took off and on 2 weeks because I was trying to do too much, learned alot and implemented some cool things
